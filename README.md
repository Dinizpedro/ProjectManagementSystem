# Design Patterns
Several design patterns were used in order to keep the software easy to read and maintaim:
- SOLID;
- GRASP;
- Avoid STUPID;

For software modeling we used DDD principles (Domain Driven Design).

For software architecture we adopted Onion Architecture.

# Tech Stack
- Front end: React | JavaScript
- Back end: SpringBoot | Java
- Databse: H2 Database
- Testing: Junit, Mockito (For this project, a coverage level of 95% and a mutation of 80% were required. Alot of focus on testing - TDD )
