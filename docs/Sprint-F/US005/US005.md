## 3. Design - User Story Realization

## 3.1. Sequence Diagram (SD)

This user story starts with a Director wanting to create a new project. 

To do this, the Director must insert the code, name, description, sprint duration, business sector and budget; and select
start date, end date, customer name, typology description and project manager email. Project status is "Planned" by default.

If these requirements are met, a new Project will be created in the system.

# 4. Tests

Test scenarios created for this US (relevant integration tests).
<p></p>

**TEST 1:** Creation of new Project fails due input data does not respect the business rules established.
<p></p>

**TEST 2:** Creation of new Project fails due input project code already existing for a Project in the database.
<p></p>

**TEST 3:** Creation of new Project fails due input customer name that don't exist in the database.
<p></p>

**TEST 4:** Creation of new Project fails due input typology description that don't exist in the database.
<p></p>

**TEST 5:** Creation of new Project fails due input email (pm) that don't exist in the database.
<p></p>

**TEST 6:** Creation of new Project is successful and a representation of said Project with a link to get it should be returned, along with the created HTTP status.
