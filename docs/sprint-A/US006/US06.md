# US04 - I want to update profiles assigned to a user account.
=======================================


## **1.Requirements Engineering**

### **1.1. User Story Description**

As Administrator, I want to to update profiles assigned to a user account.

### **1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications** 
    
**From the specifications document:**

- The system should allow the configuration of profiles associated with users, in order to restrict
access to features. Each profile will have permissions associated with available actions and
functionalities. A user account can have one or more profiles.
- When registration is made, it is automatically associated with the visitor/guest profile, and
then the administrator can add other available profiles.
- The Administrator profile allows associating profiles with the remaining users of the system,
and therefore an account with this profile should be automatically created at the time the
system is installed.

**From the client clarifications:**
    

**From Group Discussion:**
- After discussing with the team, we decided to create a method that will switch a user's profile by a new one.
    

### **1.3. Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC1:** Only the Administrator can update a user's profile.

### **1.4. Found out Dependencies**

* There is a dependency to the [**US003** - *"As Visitor I want to send a request to the administrator to assign him/her a given profile."*](/docs/sprint-A/US003). The requested profile will be the new profile that the user will receive.

* There is also a dependency to the [**US13**  *" - As Administrator, I want to create user profiles"*](/docs/sprint-B/US13). This profile that are created will be assigned to the users by the Administrator.
