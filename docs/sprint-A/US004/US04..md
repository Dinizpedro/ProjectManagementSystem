# US04 - Search for users
=======================================


## **1.Requirements Engineering**

### **1.1. User Story Description**

As Administrator, I want to search for users.

### **1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications** 
    
**From the specifications document:**

- The administrator should be able to search for users with availability of at least the following fields: email and profile.

**From the client clarifications:**
    

**From Group Discussion:**
- After discussing with the team, we decided to create a method that will loop through a user list and find users with a given email or profile.
    

### **1.3. Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC1:** Only the Administrator can search for users.

### **1.4. Found out Dependencies**

* There is a dependency to the [**US001** - *"As Non-Registered User, I want to registar as an application user."*](/docs/sprint-A/US001). When a user registers, he uses an email. This email is what the administrator will type when he wants to search for a specific user.

* There is also a dependency to the [**US06**  *" As Administrator, I want to update profiles assigned to a user account."*](/docs/sprint-A/US06). The administrator can update profiles and will be able to search for users with that specific profile.



### **1.5. Input and Output Data**

#### **Input Data:**

* **Typed data:**
  - type of search (by email or profile)
  - searchField (word that will be searched)
   
#### **Output Data:**

- List of Users
