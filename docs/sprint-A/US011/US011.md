# US011 -  As Authenticated User, I want to change his/her password.
=======================================


## **1.Requirements Engineering**

### **1.1. User Story Description**

As Authenticated User, I wanto to change his/her password
    
### **1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

**From the specifications document:**

- To get acess to the system a user must enter credentials in the forma of email and 
password.
- Each user's registration must request some information like password and password confirmation;
- The login form shold have a link that allows users to reset their passwords.
- Passwords should not be openly saved to the database allowing them ti be read or decrypted by a user with acess 
to the database.


**From the client clarifications:**
- A password can only be stored encrypted.


**From Group Discussion:**
- After meeting with the Product Owner and meeting in group we achieved the following conclusions:
- When the password is created, a method for encryption must be generated;
- For change the atual password, a user must introduce the old password first, to confirm the user validation and,
  only before that, put the new one.

### **1.3. Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC1** A password only can change if the user write the old and de new one;
* **AC2** To be possible to change a password, the old and the new password must be different; 
* **AC3** To create or change a password we must respect a series of validations such as the length of the password 
and the requirement for special characters.
* **AC4** When you create a new user, a password must be created.

### **1.4. Found out Dependencies**

* There is a dependency to [**US001** - *"As Non-Registered User, I want to register as an application user"*]


### **1.5. Input and Output Data**

#### **Input Data:**

* **Typed data:**
    - String oldPassword;
    - String newPassword;
    - String passwordToHash;
    - int id;
 

#### **Output Data:**

- Boolean: if password changed successfully, returns **true**; otherwise, returns **false**.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Business Rules
The password change and it's value objects have the following business rules:

| **_Value Objects_** | **_Business Rules_**                                                                                                              |
|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Password**        | Alphanumerical characters with minimnun size 8 and maximun 20. Must have a special caracter and must contain letters and numbers. |


### 2.2. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

## 3.1. Sequence Diagram (SD)
Bellow is the sequence diagram that describes how - and in what order - the objects works to reach the goal of the user story.

## 3.2. Class Diagram (CD)

Bellow is the class diagram, that describes the attributes and operations of a class and also the constraints imposed on the system.

# 4. Tests

The unitary tests of this US are listed below. Tests were made in order to ensure the sprint's status change efficiency, 
allowing it to change from the status "planned" to "ongoing". 
In case of absence of one or more scenarios, like status and time, as well as the usage of invalid parameters, the result
of the performed tests will be false. In this case we can verify a method efficiency.

**PasswordTes:** In this class we performed tests to confirm that the password complied with the rules initially 
discussed and, if it did not, we performed tests not obeying the rules Such tests showed that
the method created to change the password is working as expected.
<p></p>

**ImplUserControllerTest:** Start of the sprint failure because the end date of the previous sprint is greater than the 
start date of the current sprint.
<p></p>

**UserServiceTest:** In this class we tested the purpose of the method created to change the password, as well as sending
the response from the server, which will be positive if everything goes as planned or negative if not.
