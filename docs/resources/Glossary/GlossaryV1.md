# Project Glossary

## A

##### Administration *(software functionality)*
Manage user accounts and associate their profiles available to solution administrators, manage resources and general configuration.

##### Administrator *(user profile)*
The Administrator profile allows associating profiles with the remaining users of the system, and therefore an account with this profile should be automatically created at the time the system is installed.

##### Administration Area *(System)*
System area that allows the administrator to perform tasks such as system user lists, searching for users with email and profile availability, associating user accounts with existing profiles, activating or deactivating accounts, and editing account definitions.

##### Allocations report *(system functionality)*
The allocations report displays information about the projects in which each resource is assigned at a given time. For a specified start and end date, clear and easy-to-query information about the distribution of time by the different projects is displayed.
For the Director profile, information about the allocation of all users registered in the system is listed.
For the Project Manager, PO, and SM profiles, only the information corresponding to projects
to which the user has access as a manager is listed.
For the User profile, only the information relating to himself is displayed.

##### Profile (also known as *User Profile*)
The system should allow the configuration of profiles associated with users, in order to restrict access to features. Each profile will have permissions associated with available actions and functionalities. 
A user account can have one or more profiles. When registration is made, it is automatically associated with the visitor/guest profile, and then the administrator can add other available profiles.

##### Project
The base entity that serves for the association of activities and resources. The Director profile has permission to modify all properties of any given project. The Project Manager is also able to modify some parts (which?) of the project being currently managed by himself.

##### Project management *(software functionality)*
Project creation and management, including the creation of activities, the association of resources to projects, and the record of progress in activities.

##### Project Manager *(special profile)*
When creating a project on the system, a user is defined as the manager of that project, making that user project manager, remaining a "regular" user in the other projects to which is assigned.

##### Project Registration *(software functionality)*
The system allows the registration of new projects. The process of creating information relating to a project is available exclusively for the
Director profile. The Project Manager is able to edit part of the information.

##### Project Search *(software funcionality)*
The system is equipped with a form that allows the search of projects. Searchable fields are:

##### Software Development Process (SDP) *(concept)*
It is also known as a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Is a systematic process for building software that ensures the quality and correctness of the software built. SDP process aims to produce high-quality software that meets customer expectations. The system development should be complete in the predefined time frame and cost. SDP consists of a detailed plan which explains how to plan, build, and maintain specific software. Every phase of the SDP life Cycle has its own process and deliverables that feed into the next phase[3].

##### Special profile *(profile category)*
The Project Manager, Product Owner, and Scrum Master profiles are special profiles since they are not fixed profiles assigned to particular users, but the result of the roles the users have in a particular project over a certain period. 

##### SPI *(concept)*
The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of the conformance of actual progress (earned value) to the planned progress: SPI = EV / PV. [4]

##### Sprint

##### System funcionalities(?)
Manage user account associates their profiles available to solution administrators, manage resources and general configuration; 
Project creation and management, including the creation of activities, an association of resources to projects, and record of progress in activities;
Generate reports aligned with user profile’s needs;

## T

##### Task(Category?)
A task is a subitem of the user stories. A task is an elementary concept that defines a particular set of work to be attended.

##### Task status
Current stage of a task. Can have the status: 
* Planned;
* Running;
* Finished;
* Blocked.

##### Task update
A particular scenario of updating tasks is to update the effort. As each resource spends time with a task, it updates it with the time recording used. Each update originates a record with a comment associated with the task, where attachment files can be added. These task updates are allowed by the users associated with a project (the project team).

##### Testing
Tasks related to finding errors, gaps, or missing requirements in comparison to the actual requirements.

##### Typology *(project registration)*
Way that the project is budgeted. Can be: 
* fixed cost;
* time and materials.

## U

##### User (Profile)
The User corresponds to the resources that perform tasks/effort in the activities of the projects.

##### User Account
User accounts allow you to share a computer with multiple people while keeping your original files and settings. For each person to be able to access their account, a name and a password are required.

##### User Registration
The User registration is made accessible through a form accessible via a link in the login zone. Each user's registration requests a name, a function, an e-mail, a password, a password confirmation, and a photo, this last one being optional.

##### User Management
The system should have an administration area, which allows the system administrator to perform different activities, such as, list all system users, search for users with availability (e-mail and profile), associate user accounts with existing profiles, activate and inactivate user accounts, and edit other user account information.

##### User Story
A user story is made up of one or several individual tasks. User stories can be created and are controlled by the PO. Generally worked on by more than one person.

## V
