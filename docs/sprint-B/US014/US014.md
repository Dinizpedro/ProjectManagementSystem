# US027 -  Define the Scrum Master of a project.
=======================================


## **1.Requirements Engineering**

### **1.1. User Story Description**

As Director, I want to define the SM of a project.

### **1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

**From the specifications document:**

- The director should have the ability to associate resources with projects.
- The scrum master cannot be changed during the sprint.

**From Group Discussion:**

After meeting with the Product Owner and meeting in group we achieved the following conclusions:
- As the scrum master cannot be changed during the sprint, it has to be changed at the beginning. So, as a team, we had the idea that whenever the sprint is in the planned state, we can associate the scrum master with the project that has that sprint.
- There has to be a list of scrum master so we can see a history of who was once a scrum master on this project.

### **1.3. Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC1:** A director must be able to define a resource.
* **AC2:** All attributes must be filled.
* **AC3:** The user email must correspond with a resource in the project.
* **AC4:** The project code must correspond with a project present in the project store.
* **AC5:** The sprint number must correspond with the project present in the project sprint list.

### **1.4. Found out Dependencies**

* This User Story is dependent to the [**US07** - *As Director, I want associate a resource to a project.*](/docs/sprint-A/US07)

### **1.5. Input and Output Data**

#### **Input Data:**
* **Typed data:**
  - User Email;
  - Project code;
  - Sprint number.

* **Selected data:**
  - Selected User from a list of Users;
  - Selected Project from a list of Projects;
  - Selected Resource from a list of Resources, with user, project and sprint number, to know who you want to be set as the scrum master;

#### **Output Data:**

- Defined/associated resource to a project.
- Success or unsuccessful of the operation.

# 4. Tests

Test scenarios created for this US.

- **UNIT TEST 1:**  Verify that the Scrum Master is successfully assigned to the project.

- **UNIT TEST 2:**  Verify that the Scrum Master has not been successfully assigned to the project because the email entered is incorrect.

- **UNIT TEST 3:**  Verify that the Scrum Master was not successfully assigned to the project because the project code is incorrect.

- **UNIT TEST 4:**  Verify that the Scrum Master was not successfully assigned to the project because the sprint number is incorrect/out of range.
