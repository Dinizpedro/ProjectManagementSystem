# US025 - I want to inactivate a user account.
=======================================


## **1.Requirements Engineering**

### **1.1. User Story Description**

As Administrator, I want to inactivate a user account.

### **1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

**From the specifications document:**

The system should have an administration area, which allows the system administrator to
perform the following activities:

     -  Activate and inactivate user accounts; 

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** *"Um utilizador que esteja numa Lista de recursos de um/vários projetos poderá ter a conta desativada?"*
>
> **Answer:** *"Sim. Sem qualquer outra implicação no sistema."  (cf . https://bitbucket.org/switch-2021/project_wiki/wiki/User%20Stories)*

**From Group Discussion:**
- After meeting with the Product Owner and meeting in group we achieved the following conclusions:
- Inactivation of an user account is only about access to the system, with no further consequences.
- It is possible to inactive an user account that is involved in a project, the user remains in the project but loses
- the access to the system.
- Whenever an user account is inactivated, it sets an inactivation date to the current date of the inactivation.


### **1.3. Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC1:** It is not possible to inactivate an account that is already inactive.
* **AC2:** An account can be inactivated even if the user is involved in a project.
* **AC3:** The user account has to be present in the user list of the system.
* **AC4:** If the user does not exist in the user list of the system, an exception is thrown.

### **1.4. Found out Dependencies**

* There is a dependency to the [**US001** - *As Non-Registered User, 
I want to register as an application user*](/docs/sprint-A/US001).
* Only an account that has been created and added to the system can be inactivated later.

* There is also a dependency to the [**US002** - *As Non-Registered User, 
I want to activate a just registered user account*](/docs/sprint-A/US002).
* Only accounts that have been activated can be inactivated later.


### **1.5. Input and Output Data**

#### **Input Data:**

* **Typed data:**
    - an email (to identify the user)

* **Selected data:**
    - Selected user from the user list to inactivate his account.


#### **Output Data:**

- Account inactivated.
- Success of the operation.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

## 3.1. Sequence Diagram (SD)

This user story is about the administrator inactivating an user account. For this to be possible 
the administrator has to insert an email adress (user account indentifier) which has to match the email
of an user account in the user list of the system. Then a validation regarding if the user is already inactive
takes place and only then the user account is inactivated and registers his inactivation date.

# 4. Tests

**Unit test 1:** Verify that it is not possible to inactivate an account that is already inactive
**Unit test 2:** Verify that user must exist in the user list to be inactivated
**Unit Test 3:** Verify that user must be active to be inactivated.
**Unit Test 4:** Verify that an inactivation date is set when user is inactivated.
