# US029 -  As Project Manager, I want to start a sprint.
=======================================


## **1.Requirements Engineering**

### **1.1. User Story Description**

As Project Manager, I want to start a sprint.

### **1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications** 
    
### **1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

**From the specifications document:**

- Each sprint has a "sprint backlog", i.e. the set of user stories that should be addressed during the sprint.
- The project timeline is divided into sprints (multiple of weeks), typically of the predefined duration, and the project team, PO and SM don’t change during the sprint.
- 

<p>
   A sprint must have at least the following information:

     - Sprint duration (inicial estimate);
     - Number of planned sprints;
     - End Date (date it was closed);


**From the client clarifications:**
n/a


**From Group Discussion:**
- After meeting with the Product Owner and meeting in group we achieved the following conclusions:
- A sprint must only have a start date and duration. Through inserting the duration of a sprint we are able to calculate its end.
- It must only exist one sprint with the status *"Ongoing"*. All the others are with the status *"Planned"* or *"Done"*.
- All dates must be validated, in order to have the startDate of a sprint ongoing after the endDate of the sprint before.

### **1.3. Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC1** A sprint only can change to a "start" status if it already exists previous sprints created with "planned" status
* **AC2** To be possible to change a sprint status, from "planned" to "start", it will be necessary to have the attributes duration and time
* **AC3** First of all, before reaching the sprint, it's crucial to select a project (from an existing list projects) through the code and, afterward, select a sprint from an existing list of sprints by using a sprint number
* **AC4** After the project and sprint being define, we will need to have a starting date and an ending date (obtained through the attribute duration), in order to be possible to start the sprint

### **1.4. Found out Dependencies**

* There is a dependency to [**US022** - *" As Project Manager, I want to create a sprint."*]


### **1.5. Input and Output Data**

#### **Input Data:**

* **Typed data:**
    - String projectCodeDto;
    - int sprintNumberDto;
    - String startDateDto;
    - int durationInWeeks;
 

#### **Output Data:**

- Boolean: if start sprint is successfully, returns **true**; otherwise, returns **false**.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Business Rules
The task creation and it's value objects have the following business rules:

| **_Value Objects_**         | **_Business Rules_**                                                                                                                                 |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ProjectCode**             | Alphanumerical with 5 characters.                                                                  |
| **SprintNumber**                 | Number between 1 and 999 |
| **StartDate**    | The initial date of the sprint that we want to use, it should always be bigger then the end date of the previous sprint|
| **DurationInWeeks**  | Sprint duration in weeks. Through this input and the "StartDate" we will be able to calculate the end date. |

# 4. Tests

The unitary tests of this US are listed below. Tests were made in order to ensure the sprint's status change efficiency, allowing it to change from the status "planned" to "ongoing". 
In case of absence of one or more scenarios, like status and time, as well as the usage of invalid parameters, the result of the performed tests will be false. In this case we can verify a method efficiency.

**TEST 1:** Successfuly start of the sprint. 
<p></p>

**TEST 2:** Start of the sprint failure because the end date of the previous sprint is greater than the start date of the current sprint.
<p></p>

**TEST 3:** Start of the sprint failure because Status is null.
<p></p>

**TEST 4:** Start of the sprint failure because Time is Null.

<p></p>

**TEST 5:** Start of the sprint failure because there is more than one sprint with the status "ongoing".
<p></p>

**TEST 6:** Validation to check if the "ongoing" status is unique.
