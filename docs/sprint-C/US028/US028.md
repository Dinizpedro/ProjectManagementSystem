# US028 - Get a list of all human resources in a project.

## **1.Requirements Engineering**

### **1.1. User Story Description**

As Director, I want to get a list of all human resources in a project.

### **1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

**From the client clarifications:**

G6, 25/01

> **Question:** * "Pretende visualizar os recursos ativos ou todos aqueles que já participaram no projeto?"

> **Answer:** * "PO Todos afetos ao projeto. (AMM, 27/01)"

G3, 31/01

> **Question:** * "Que informações devem ser devolvidas/fornecidas ao utilizador do sistema sobre os recursos humanos alocados a um determinado projecto. Basta, por exemplo, o nome e e-mail dos recursos ou é necessário fornecer mais dados?"

> **Answer:** * "PO Nome, email e função parecem adequados. (AMM, 03/02)"



**From Group Discussion:**

- During group discussion we decided that we should consider to start using the DTO Pattern if it was justifiable to
  use.
- We also thought initially that with a mapper dedicated to each resource and another one dedicated to a DTO of a group
  of individual resources would work better.
- After meeting with the Product Owner and reflecting on some changes we achieved the following conclusions:
- There should and will be some adjustments to this user story, however , at that time we thought that would be better
  to try to improve what we had and then, with more time, implement some changes.

### **1.3. Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC1:** A Director must be able to get a list of all human resources of a project.
* **AC2:** All attributes must be filled.
* **AC3:** Each resource should be identified with an email and a name.

### **1.4. Found out Dependencies**

* There is a dependency to the US005 - As Director, I want to register/create a new project. In order to get the
  resources of a project, we need a created project with Resources allocated.

### **1.5. Input and Output Data**

#### **Input Data:**

* **Typed data:**
    - String projectCode;

* **Selected data:**
    - Selected Project from the Project Store;
    - Selected Resources from Project;

#### **Output Data:**

- List of Human resources in a project.
- Operation completed succefully.


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Business Rules

The task creation and it's value objects have the following business rules:

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

## 3.1. Sequence Diagram (SD)

The goal of this user story is to get the list of all human resources of a certain project. After a close look at the
SD, we can observe the flow of this operation. It starts with the user input of a string that's the equivalent of the
identifier, the project code. The controller uses this information to access the desired project , going through the
data management that points to the project Store where the referred project is stored. After this, inside the project
there is a method that aggregates all the human resources and sends them as Resources to the humanResourcesDTOMapper.
The purpose of this mapper is to group these resources in a list as individual DTO's. In order to do this is used a
second mapper, resourceMapper. In this mapper , the method resourceToDTO , converts individually each resource to a dto
that contains the email and the name of that specific resource. Finally, the first mapper, human resources, agreggates
all of these individual DTO's and sends them to the user as the result of their request.

The use case diagram represents the actors involved in the process of getting the human resources list.

## 3.4. Design Patterns

For the past weeks , many new concepts and design patterns were introduced. In order to improve the reliability and
control of our project, by restricting the instantiation of the class Data Management (the class that knows the system
globally), we've been implementing the Singleton pattern. Besides that, we've also been trying to use and implement some
GRASP and SOLID principals. On this note , the controllers were also implemented , and given the job of delegating
responsibilities throughout the system. In this US's case, the controller, after collecting the project code and running
it through the Store , will assign to the project , the responsibility of gathering the Resources that it contains.
After that , by pure fabrication, the Mappers will generate and handle the DTO's with the necessary information, ideally
, protected as much as possible.


# 4. Tests

There are several unitary tests that make sure that the code is prepared for some borderline situations. Besides testing
the Dto's attributes , it's also tested situations like:

- The success scenery where the list of human resources is returned.
- Trying to get resources from a project that has them as null. Getting the null pointer exception.
- Trying to get resources from a null project. Getting the null pointer exception.
- Trying to get resources from a non-existent project. Getting the null pointer exception.

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

The implementation of this US was, for me, the hardest by now. By trying to use the new concepts we've been learning
made the resolution of this US a bit blurry at the beginning of the sprint. One of the main problems was that our
Resource Class wasn't prepared to give or have the information that we thought we needed. More specifically , the role
of the resource. In order to surpass that situation , having the principals of Grasp in mind, we've decided to extract
the role directly from the "selected project" (it is one of its attributes), and convert it into a DTO with name and
email as content. After that, by agglomerating these new objects in another DTO, the role became "implicit". To do that,
we've used the methods and classes shown bellow.

## Class GetHumanResourcesControllerController

    public HumanResourcesDTO humanResourcesList(String projectCode) {
        Project theProject = getDataManagement().getProjectStore().getProject(projectCode);
        return theProject.getHumanResourcesOfAProject();
    }

## Class Project

**Method to get the human resources from the project**

    public HumanResourcesDTO getHumanResourcesOfAProject() {
      return HumanResourcesMapper.humanResourceToDTO(this.scrumMaster,
        this.projectManager, this.productOwner, this.projectTeam);
    }

## Mappers and DTO

### Class ResourceMapper

**Map Methods that transform a Resource or a Resources List to a DTO**

    public static ResourceDTO toResourcesDTO(Resource resource) {

        String email = resource.getResourceEmail();

        String name = resource.getUser().getUserName();

        return new ResourceDTO(email, name);
    }

    public static List<ResourceDTO> toResourceListDTO(List<Resource> resourceList) {
        List<ResourceDTO> resourceDTOList = new ArrayList<>();

        for (Resource resource : resourceList) {
            ResourceDTO resourceDTO = toResourcesDTO(resource);
            resourceDTOList.add(resourceDTO);
        }

        return resourceDTOList;
    }

}

### Class HumanResourcesMapper

    public static HumanResourcesDTO humanResourceToDTO(Resource scrumMaster, Resource projectManager, Resource productOwner, List<Resource> projectTeam) {

    ResourceDTO scrumMasterDTO = ResourceMapper.toResourcesDTO(scrumMaster);
    ResourceDTO projectManagerDTO = ResourceMapper.toResourcesDTO(projectManager);
    ResourceDTO productOwnerDTO = ResourceMapper.toResourcesDTO(productOwner);
    List<ResourceDTO> projectTeamDTO = ResourceMapper.toResourceListDTO(projectTeam);

    return new HumanResourcesDTO(scrumMasterDTO, projectManagerDTO, productOwnerDTO, projectTeamDTO);
    }

}

### Class ResourceDTO

    public String email;

    public String name;

    public ResourceDTO(final String email, final String name) {
        this.email = email;
        this.name = name;
    }

}

### Class HumanResourcesDTO

    public ResourceDTO scrumMaster;

    public ResourceDTO projectManager;

    public List<ResourceDTO> projectTeam;

    public ResourceDTO productOwner;

    public HumanResourcesDTO(ResourceDTO scrumMaster, ResourceDTO projectManager, ResourceDTO productOwner, List<ResourceDTO> projectTeam) {
        this.scrumMaster = scrumMaster;
        this.productOwner = productOwner;
        this.projectManager = projectManager;
        this.projectTeam = projectTeam;
    }
    }

# 6. Observations

As I said before, for me , due to many circumstances these past two weeks were the hardest. The amount of work, covid
related incidentals and some wear from the semester were critical. That being said , they're also very fulfilling. I
think im starting to being able to shift the way I contemplate solutions and consider problems to a more effective,
efficient and object-oriented format. At this final stage , I even have some ideas already on how to change and update
some flaws from what I've done until now. Also, although sometimes frustrating, I would like to acknowledge the benefits
of project based learning. My teammates were decisive in this process and im very grateful for that.
