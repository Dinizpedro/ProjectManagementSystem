# US026 - I want to activate a user account.
=======================================


## **1.Requirements Engineering**

### **1.1. User Story Description**

As Administrator, I want to activate a user account.

### **1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

**From the specifications document:**

The system should have an administration area, which allows the system administrator to
perform the following activities:

     -  Activate and inactivate user accounts;

**From Group Discussion:**
- After meeting with the Product Owner and meeting in group we achieved the following conclusions:
- Activation of an user account is only about access to the system, with no further consequences.
- Whenever an user account is activated, it sets an activation date to the current date of the activation.

### **1.3. Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC1:** It is not possible to activate an account that is already active.
* **AC2:** The user account has to be present in the user list of the system.
* **AC3:** If the user does not exist in the user list of the system, an exception is thrown.

### **1.4. Found out Dependencies**

* There is a dependency to the [**US001** - *As Non-Registered User,
  I want to register as an application user*](/docs/sprint-A/US001).
* Only an account that has been created and added to the system can be inactivated later.

* There is also a dependency to the [**US025** - *- As Administrator, 
I want to inactivate a user account*](/docs/sprint-C/US025).
* Only accounts that are inactive can be activated.


### **1.5. Input and Output Data**

#### **Input Data:**

* **Typed data:**
    - an email (to identify the user).

* **Selected data:**
    - Selected user from the user list to activate his account.


#### **Output Data:**

- Account activated.
- Success of the operation.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

## 3.1. Sequence Diagram (SD)
This user story is about the administrator activating an user account. For this to be possible
the administrator has to insert an email adress (user account indentifier) which has to match the email
of an user account in the user list of the system. Then a validation regarding if the user is already active
takes place and only then the user account is inactivated and registers his inactivation date.

## 3.2. Class Diagram (CD)
Bellow is the class diagram, that describes the attributes and operations of a class and also the constraints imposed on the system.

# 4. Tests
Test scenarios created for this US.
We only represent the type of tests made for this User Story.

**Unit test 1:** Verify that it is not possible to activate an account that is already active
**Unit test 2:** Verify that user must exist in the user list to be activated
**Unit Test 3:** Verify that user must be inactive to be activated.
**Unit Test 4:** Verify that an activation date is set when user is activated.
