# US024 - Get a list of all user accounts and their status
=======================================


## **1.Requirements Engineering**

### **1.1. User Story Description**

As Administrator, I want to get a list all user accounts and their status

### **1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications** 
    
**From the specifications document:**

- All user accounts will have a status that will specify if the account is active or inactive. 
- When the user account is registered the default status is inactive.
- After an user account is created an automatic link is sent to the user's email so he can activate its account status.
- The administrator has the ability to activate or inactivate the status of any user account.


**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** *A lista que queremos retornar, deverá conter somente o elemento identificativo do utilizador (email) e o seu estado (ativo/desativo)?*
>
> **Answer:** *Como ainda não se vai mostrar nada (não temos UI), não sabemos exatamente o que é preciso. Email e estado parecem-me bem. Mais tarde, pode vir a precisar de mais coisas...*
    


**From Group Discussion:**
- After meeting with the Product Owner and meeting in group we achieved the following conclusions:
- The data that will be 'presented' to the user will only have two informations: the user's email and its status (active/inactive). 
- Later on we might need to add more information to this list.
    

### **1.3. Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC1:** Only the Administrator has the ability to see a list of all user accounts and their status.

### **1.4. Found out Dependencies**

* There is a dependency to the [**US002** - *"As Non-Registered User, I want to activate a just registered user account."*](/docs/sprint-A/US002). Because in this US the user can activate its own account.

* There is also a dependency to the [**US025**  *"As Administrator, I want to inactivate a user account"*](/docs/sprint-C/US025). The administrator can inactivate a user account.
* There is also a dependency to the [**US026**  *"As Administrator, I want to activate a user account"*](/docs/sprint-C/US026). The administrator can activate a user account.
